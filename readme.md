# Introduction

A minimalistic site generator for mostly static content, intended for a blog type site.

## Content

Put your content into the `site/` folder and posts into `site/posts/`. The generator pulls all settings from the `generator.inc.php` file. This should also include your list of posts.

Look at the existing example if you want more details.

Run `php generate.php` to generate the site.
